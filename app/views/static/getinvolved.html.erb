                  <h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>
                  <p><strong>I’m implementing a project in conjunction with a number of organizations. Can I apply on behalf of multiple organizations?</b></strong>
                  <p>Unfortunately, funding can only be granted to one organization per application, although you may work with other partners to implement the project.</p>
                  <p><strong>I’m seeking funding for a small component of a larger project. Can I apply?</strong></p>
                  <p>Yes. The purpose of the fund is to promote uptake and innovative use of Global Forest Watch. However, you must articulate how GFW will be used for the relevant component of your project.</p>
                  <p><strong>I won’t be able to finish the project by December 31, 2015. Can I apply?</strong></p>
                  <p>Yes. However, in your application, you must describe the activities and outcomes that can be achieved in the time allotted, and how they tie into the larger project goal.</p>
                  <p><strong>Can the application be filled out in languages other than English?</strong></p>
                  <p>Unfortunately, we can only accept applications in English. However, we can provide some level of guidance in Spanish, Portuguese, Bahasa and in select other languages as needed. Please contact gfwfund@wri.org.</p>
                  <p><strong>My project seeks funding to purchase equipment, seedlings, or other materials. Can I use the SGF award for this purpose?</strong></p>
                  <p>No. Given the short term of projects, we cannot award funding for this purpose. However, a portion of funding requested may go towards equipment, such as portable internet sticks, but we typically request that this amount be below 5,000 USD.</p>
                  <p><strong>I applied to the SGF last year, but was not accepted. Will my application be given special consideration?</strong></p>
                  <p>No. All applications will be reviewed against the same criteria. However, we encourage previous applicants to apply.</p>
                  <p><strong>I’m not sure what Global Forest Watch is. How can I determine whether this platform can be used for my project?</strong></p>
                  <p>All applications must describe how GFW will play a critical role in the project. To find out more information about GFW, visit the about or how to pages. You can also view a summary of previous projects in the Guidelines for Prospective Applicants.</p>
                  <p><strong>Can I apply as an individual, not as an organization?</strong></p>
                  <p>No. Unfortunately, only organizations are eligible to apply. Please see the Guidelines for Prospective Applicants for more information.</p>
                  <p><strong>I work for a large, international organization, but we’re implementing a project with a local partner. Can I still apply?</strong></p>
                  <p>Yes. International organizations are eligible to apply if the proposed project is at the national or subnational level. In this case, organizations are encouraged to work with local partners.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>Do you have a question that’s not on this list? Please consult the Guidelines for Prospective Applicants or email <a class="btn gray uppercase medium" href="mailto:gfwfund@wri.org">gfwfund@wri.org</a>.</p>
